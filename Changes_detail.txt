Changes by HHI (Karsten Suehring)
---------------------------------

* added ERPS Syntax and decoding functionality (RTP)
 
  - only RTP NAL (bitstream will follow)
  - whole ERPS syntax should be decodable
  - Encoder contains some sample code (see defines _CHECK_MULTI_BUFFER_1_ , _CHECK_MULTI_BUFFER_2_ )
  - reference frame buffer changed:
    -> mref, mcef, Refbuf11 have positive indexes always starting with "0" (no frame_cycle)
    for details see mbuffer.c / mbuffer.h

 Note:
   - The routines have been tested, but I may have missed to correct a reference counter
   - Be careful using the long term buffer - Do to the missing encoder infrastructure they
     could not be tested very well
   - There are some small memory leaks remaining (fixes will follow)
   - remapping of picture numbers has a bug if used twice (encoder/decoder mismatch)


* cleaned up memory allocation

  - get_mem[23]D funtion moved into a separate file in lcommon directory (for use in
    both encoder and decoder)
  - added free_mem[23]D functions
    (TODO: uses these at the encoder)

* Cleaned up bitstream file

  - we only have one start code (slice start code)
  - moved PictureHeader funtionality to SliceHeader
    (we don't have picture headers, so don't confuse people with old function names)



Changes by TUM (Tobias Oelbaum) / TUB (Stephan Wenger)
------------------------------------------------------

* Added data partitioning for RTP

* Changed detection of lost slices and lost partitions

* Removed img->slice_numbers (same information is given in img->mb_data.slice_nr)
* Removed Slice->slice_nr (same information is given in img->current_slice_nr)

* Added some lines code to enable correct decoding if _ERROR_CONCEALMENT_  is set to 0 

* Devided SE_DELTA_QUANT into SE_DELTA_QUANT_INTER and SE_DELTA_QUANT_INTRA to enable correct decoding in case of packet losses and data partitioning.
  SE_DELTA_QUANT_INTER is assigned to the partition containing the inter coefficients
  SE_DELTA_QUANT_INTRA is assigned to the partition containing the intra coefficients

* Moved SE_INTRAPREDMODE from the first partition to the partition containing the intra coefficients
  In case data partitioning is chosen UseConstrainedIntraPred must be set to 1 (this is checked in PatchInp)

* Adapted the simulation of the distortion at the decoder in the encoder to the error concealment techniques available if data partitioning was choosen
* Added new input parameters
  - LossRateA 
  - LossRateB
  - LossRateC

* Bugfix frame numbers in case of B-Frames 

* Added Parameter NumberBFrames to RTP InfoSet (necessary for detecting lost frames)


Known Bugs:

- Marker bit is not written correctly (to Stephan Wenger)
- Data Partitioning does not work with CABAC
