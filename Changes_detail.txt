Changes for JM 6.2
------------------

The decoder should be nearly in JVT-G50 (final draft) state. 

Known problems:
  - the old Parameter Set syntax is used by default. Enable
    #define G50_SPS
    in defines.h for the new syntax
  - the transform/inverse transform has not been reversed
  - the direct modes seem to have some mismatches (compared with the
    HHI implementation) for MB AFF (Alexis Tourapis is working on that)
  - PCM macroblock mode not supported
  - deblocking filter is not aligned to the text
  - reference picture reordering / mmco hasn't got much testing

The encoder in this version is completely broken. I started merging some
code from the decoder, but currently don't have the time to finish that.

If you're interested in encoder work, please contact me.
